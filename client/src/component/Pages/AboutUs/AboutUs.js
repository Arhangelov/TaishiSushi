                <h3>TASTE IS A FEELING</h3>
                <p>The cozy atmosphere, delicious food and incredible experience are only a part of Taishi Japanese Food and Garden.</p>
                <p>The restaurant focuses on authentic dishes inspired by the Japanese cuisine. The Venue boasts a modern interior in a calm and cozy atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The indoor section of the restaurant is housed inside an original Japanese Sekura house with a unique interior which was imported directly from Japan.</p>
                <p>Taishi is one of the few restaurants which offer dishes made on a robata. This is a method of cooking similar to barbecue - literally translated it means “cooking on fire” which allows perfect roasting while maintaining all the taste qualities of the ready products.</p>
                <p>The literal translation of the hieroglyph “umami” means astonishing taste. But it also more of everything else. Umami is a …. true feast for the senses</p>
